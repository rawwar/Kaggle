We will be Analysing data by exploration. I think one of the most important thing to keep in mind during EDA is asking questions and exploring data to answer those questions. Without having questions and blindly exploring data might give us some insight But, that's throwing stone in the dark and expecting to hit jackpot. So, always decide what you are looking for and then use data to answer those questions.\n\n\nCompetetion description has few example questions that i will be answering in this Notebook. But, before that i want to understand data.
